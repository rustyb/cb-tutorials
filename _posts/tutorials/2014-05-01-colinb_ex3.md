Question 1
=================


```r
# to find the S3 methods associated with 'mean' we run the following
# command.

methods("mean")
```

```
## [1] mean.data.frame mean.Date       mean.default    mean.difftime  
## [5] mean.POSIXct    mean.POSIXlt
```

The esponse from the above command. Mean provides the following five S3 functions: 

	mean.Date
	mean.default
	mean.difftime
	mean.POSIXct
	mean.POSIXlt

Question 2
===============
To calculate mean of each of the columns within it we create the following method **mean** with a function that uses **apply**.
As you may notice in the apply parameters we call **2**, what this does is to apply the mean to all columns. If we were to change this to **1** it would do so for each row. 

To create this method run the following code.


```r
mean.data.frame <- function(x) {
    apply(x, 2, mean)
}
```


Q3
===================
In order to verfiy that the method is now recognized by R we once again run the following command:


```r
methods(mean)
```

```
## [1] mean.data.frame mean.Date       mean.default    mean.difftime  
## [5] mean.POSIXct    mean.POSIXlt
```

This time the response includes the mean.data.frame function we provided.

	[1] mean.data.frame mean.Date       mean.default    mean.difftime  
	[5] mean.POSIXct    mean.POSIXlt

Q4
=============
In the same fashion as question 2 we can use the apply function once again but this time supply the parameter **1** so that the mean operator is applied to all columns.


```r
mean.data.frame <- function(x) {
    apply(x, 1, mean)
}
```


Q5
==============
There are some arguments between the function mean.

In order to test whether **trim** or **na.rm ** were being passed to the method we create a data.frame which has an NA value in the first column.
mean(x, **trim = 0, na.rm = FALSE,** ...)


```r
x <- data.frame(a = as.numeric(c(1:10, "NA")), b = c(10:20))
```

```
## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion
```

```r
mean(x)
```

```
##  [1]  5.5  6.5  7.5  8.5  9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5   NA
```

```r
# this returns an error.  next we need to modify the method so that it
# inherits the other parameters of mean by adding the ', ...'

mean.data.frame <- function(x, ...) {
    apply(x, 1, mean)
}
```


Q6
=============

Create a data.frame x

```r
x <- data.frame(a = as.numeric(c(1:10)), b = c(10:19), z = c(rnorm(10)))
class(x)
```

```
## [1] "data.frame"
```

	[1] "data.frame"

**Change the class of x to trajectory
**

```r
class(x) <- "trajectory"
```

**Create the trajectory method for plot.
**

```r
plot.trajectory <- function(df) {
    plot(x$a, x$b)
}
```

**plot x
**

```r
plot(x)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-9]({{site.baseurl}}/figure/unnamed-chunk-9.png) 


**change our trajectory method to specify a default plot type**

```r
plot.trajectory <- function(df, type = "l", ...) {
    plot(x$a, x$b, type = type, ...)
}
```

**the new line plot is made**

```r
plot(X)
```

```
## Error: object 'X' not found
```


**If we wanted to specify other parameters usually accepted by plot we can also do that**


```r
plot(x, type = "b", col = "red")
```
